## 🔒 Security Considerations

While this is a frontend-only build, the architecture is designed with security in mind:

*   **Authentication UI:** Prepared for future JWT/OAuth integration.
    
*   **Role-Based Access:** UI separation for Admin vs. User flows.
    
*   **Data Handling:** No sensitive data is stored persistently in the frontend state.
    
*   **Input Validation:** Forms are set up for future sanitization logic.
    

## 🧩 Challenges Overcome

*   **Complex Layouts:** Implementing responsive, multi-column layouts (like the Dashboard and Support page) using Tailwind CSS.
    
*   **State Management:** Handling complex UI states for tabs, modals, and chat transitions without a backend.

    
*   **Interactive Elements:** Created custom logic for the
